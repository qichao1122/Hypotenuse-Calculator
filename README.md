Description
This is a simple JavaFX application designed to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle given two side lengths (`a` and `b`).
The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to input values and display the result.
The hypotenuse is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: 

                                                  c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
